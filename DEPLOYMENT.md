# Vercel Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ **Quick Fix for 404 Errors on Page Reload**

The `vercel.json` file has been created to solve the 404 error when refreshing pages. This is required for Single Page Applications (SPAs) with client-side routing.

### **What Was Added:**

#### 1. **vercel.json Configuration**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. **Production Environment Variables**
File: `.env.production`
```env
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-backend-api-url.com
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api-url.com
```

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Update Backend URL**: 
   - Edit `.env.production` with your actual backend API URL
   - If you don't have a backend deployed yet, you can use mock data

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Vercel configuration and fix SPA routing"
   git push
   ```

3. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** with the new configuration

### **Why This Fixes the Issue:**

- **Problem**: When you visit `/login` directly or refresh the page, Vercel looks for a physical file at `/login`
- **Solution**: The `vercel.json` rewrite rule tells Vercel to serve `index.html` for ALL routes
- **Result**: React Router can handle the routing client-side, fixing the 404 error

### **Backend Deployment Options:**

Since your app needs a backend, consider these options:

1. **Railway** (Recommended for Django)
2. **Render** 
3. **Heroku** 
4. **DigitalOcean App Platform**

### **Environment Variables in Vercel:**

You can also set environment variables directly in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add `VITE_API_URL` with your backend URL

### **Testing the Fix:**

After deployment:
1. Visit your site: `https://daksystem-seven.vercel.app`
2. Navigate to `/login`
3. Refresh the page - should no longer show 404
4. All routes should work correctly with direct access

Your site should now work perfectly without 404 errors on page refresh! ðŸŽ‰
